## Give me a simple but complete and accurate step by step on how to create from zero on cloud-native spring java application

Here is a simple step-by-step guide on how to create a cloud-native Spring Java application from scratch:

**Step 1: Install Java and Spring Tool Suite (STS)**

* Install Java 11 or later (e.g., OpenJDK 11)
* Install Spring Tool Suite (STS) or your preferred IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code)

**Step 2: Create a New Spring Boot Project**

* Open STS and create a new Spring Boot project:
	+ File > New > Spring Boot Project
	+ Choose "Web" and "Cloud" as dependencies
	+ Name your project (e.g., "cloud-native-spring-app")
	+ Choose a package name (e.g., "com.example.cloudnativespringapp")

**Step 3: Configure Your Application**

* In your project's `application.properties` file, add the following configuration:
```properties
spring:
  application:
    name: cloud-native-spring-app
  cloud:
    config:
      enabled: true
  kubernetes:
    enabled: true
```
* Create a `bootstrap.properties` file with the following configuration:
```properties
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      uri: ${CONFIG_SERVER_URI:http://localhost:8888}
```
**Step 4: Implement Your Application**

* Create a new Java class (e.g., `CloudNativeSpringAppApplication`) with the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation:
```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class CloudNativeSpringAppApplication {

  @RestController
  public class CloudNativeSpringAppController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello() {
      return "Hello from Cloud Native Spring App!";
    }
  }
}
```
**Step 5: Containerize Your Application**

* Create a `Dockerfile` in your project's root directory:
```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:11-jdk-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY target/cloud-native-spring-app.jar /app/
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["java", "-jar", "cloud-native-spring-app.jar"]
```
* Build your Docker image using the following command:
```
docker build -t cloud-native-spring-app .
```
**Step 6: Create a Kubernetes Deployment**

* Create a `deployment.yaml` file in your project's root directory:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: cloud-native-spring-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: cloud-native-spring-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: cloud-native-spring-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: cloud-native-spring-app
        image: cloud-native-spring-app:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```
* Apply the deployment configuration to your Kubernetes cluster using the following command:
```
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```
**Step 7: Expose Your Application**

* Create a `service.yaml` file in your project's root directory:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: cloud-native-spring-app
spec:
  selector:
    app: cloud-native-spring-app
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
  type: LoadBalancer
```
* Apply the service configuration to your Kubernetes cluster using the following command:
```
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```
**Step 8: Test Your Application**

* Use the `kubectl` command to get the external IP address of your service:
```
kubectl get svc cloud-native-spring-app -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}'
```
* Use a tool like `curl` to test your application:
```
curl http://<EXTERNAL_IP_ADDRESS>/hello
```
You should see the response "Hello from Cloud Native Spring App!".

That's it! You've successfully created a cloud-native Spring Java application from scratch.

## is it necessary to install Sts if I already have intelij for spring claud native apps

If you already have IntelliJ IDEA, you don't necessarily need to install Spring Tool Suite (STS) to develop cloud-native Spring applications.

IntelliJ IDEA is a powerful and feature-rich IDE that provides excellent support for Spring development, including cloud-native applications. You can use IntelliJ IDEA to create, develop, and deploy your cloud-native Spring applications.

STS is a specialized IDE that is specifically designed for Spring development, and it provides some additional features and tools that are tailored to Spring development. However, if you're already comfortable with IntelliJ IDEA, you can stick with it and use its built-in features and plugins to develop your cloud-native Spring applications.

Here are some reasons why you might still want to consider using STS:

1. **Tighter integration with Spring**: STS is developed by the same team that develops the Spring Framework, so it provides a more seamless and integrated experience for Spring development.
2. **Additional Spring-specific features**: STS provides some additional features and tools that are specifically designed for Spring development, such as the Spring Boot Dashboard, Spring Cloud Config support, and more.
3. **Simplified project creation**: STS provides a simple and intuitive way to create new Spring projects, including cloud-native applications.

However, if you're already comfortable with IntelliJ IDEA and have the necessary plugins and configurations set up, you can definitely use it to develop your cloud-native Spring applications.

In summary, while STS is a great tool for Spring development, it's not necessarily required if you already have IntelliJ IDEA and are comfortable using it for your cloud-native Spring applications.
